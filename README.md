# SOP_Sequence_Data_Processing
RMD files for sequence data processing of both ITS and 16S amplicon sequence data. I prefer to follow the workflow provided by DADA2. However, in situations with poor quality reads, it may be necesasry to follow the merge first appraoach to retain a maximum number of reads.
